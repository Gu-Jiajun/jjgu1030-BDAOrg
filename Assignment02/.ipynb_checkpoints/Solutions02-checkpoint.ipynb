    "> The heuristic that most people used to justify their conclusion is the test result of the reliability of the witness under the same circumstances. As mentioned, the court tested the reliability of the witness under the same circumstances that existed on the night of the accident and concluded that the witness correctly identified each one of the two colors 80% of the time and failed 20% of the time. So when the witness identified the cab involved in the accident as Blue, without thinking any further, most people would believe that the probability should also be around 80% that the cab was actually Blue. However, they ignored the fact that 85% of the cabs in the city are Green and 15% are Blue, i.e., the Green makes up the majority of the cabs in the city. By considering this fact as the prior information, we can see from the hypothesis table in the solution to Problem 2.1, that the probability that the cab involved in the accident was actually Blue is smaller than the probability that the cab involved in the accident was actually Green. The prior information provides significant evidence favouring the hypothesis that the Green was involved in the accident."
